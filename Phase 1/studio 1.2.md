Assignment title: Visual prompt studio phase 1.2
prompt: Create a realistic black-and-white photograph of three framed family portraits placed on a dark wooden table.
The frames should be rectangular and slightly different in design. The left frame contains a close-up image of a sleeping
baby with soft lighting. The center frame shows a young child holding an object and smiling. The right frame displays a
wedding couple standing together. The photograph should be monochromatic (grayscale), with strong contrast between light 
and dark values. Use soft shadows, subtle reflections on the glass frames, and a neutral indoor background. The mood should
feel nostalgic, emotional, and centered around the theme of love and family across generations.
